## Team Reflection

This assignment allowed the team to recognize the benefits and limitations involved in manual and automated code review. Our team selection of SonarQube involved a rapid scan of the files in our project, by identifying issues that would have been time-consuming to catch through manual review alone. The automated tools, however, were missing situational context. This showed a limitation within the automated code review process. However, this allowed for all team members to manually review selected files from the scan. This was really helpful in allowing us to research related CWEs and potential mitigations. Mapping CWEs in this assignment was particularly crucial. This reinforced the impact of small security design choices that can have major implications on the security of a project. Overall, this assignment showcased the importance of using both manual and automated code review in conjunction with each other. The manual code review process allowed for a better understanding of secure code and created a tangible path to vulnerability remediation.
