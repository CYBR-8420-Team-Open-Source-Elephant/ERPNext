## Claims

### **Claim 1 - ERPNext’s role-based access control minimizes the risk of permission misconfiguration.**

![Assurance Case - APIs](/Assurance-Case-RBAC.jpg)


**Part 2 Assessment**

The documentation on both Frappe and ERPNext was readily available and clear for my research into how RBAC minimizes the risk of permission misconfiguration. I especially found the documentation regarding the audit trail, permission levels, role based permissions, and custom roles particularly helpful in supporting my top-level claim. An element I would add to fill the gaps in this documentation include task-mapping examples/outlines and audit best practices. These two elements would further support user implementation of the audit trail, permission levels, role based permissions, and custom roles.
