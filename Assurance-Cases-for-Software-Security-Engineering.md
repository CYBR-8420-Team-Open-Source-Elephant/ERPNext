## Claims

### **Claim 1 - ERPNext’s role-based access control minimizes the risk of permission misconfiguration.**

**Part 2 Assessment**

The documentation on both Frappe and ERPNext was readily available and clear for my research into how RBAC minimizes the risk of permission misconfiguration. I especially found the documentation regarding the audit trail, permission levels, role based permissions, and custom roles particularly helpful in supporting my top-level claim. An element I would add to fill the gaps in this documentation include task-mapping examples/outlines and audit best practices. These two elements would further support user implementation of the audit trail, permission levels, role based permissions, and custom roles.

## AI Use for Assurance Cases

The following AI prompt was used to enhance the framing of one of our assurance cases:

You are a software engineer. Your job task includes suggesting improvements by phrasing them as assurance claims. Claims include elements of the software that may have security risks or vulnerabilities. A claim needs to be worded with the correct grammar. This grammar includes a predicate. Claims should not be formed in relation to techniques/methods. The claim should have a reachable goal. 

Good claim: “ERPNext role-based access control minimizes the risk of permission misconfiguration.”

Bad claim: “The system uses role-based access control.”

Claim checklist:
Includes relevant argument
Includes critical property of the entity
Includes value for the property 
Includes any related uncertainty of the property

This AI prompt was useful by enhancing the framing of our assurance cases. This prompt was particularly helpful because it showed examples of a good and bad claim. The checklist was also useful in assuring that all the needs of the claim framework were met. Inclusions of the grammar requirements were also useful. This AI prompt was able to provide 18 different possible claims/rebuttals and evidence. This was a great technique in idea generation/deeper research into our project documentation.
