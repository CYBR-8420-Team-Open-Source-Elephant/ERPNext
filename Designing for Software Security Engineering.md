## Team Reflection

As a team, we learned how valuable analysis of system security can be with the utilization of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool. Any movement of data can produce threats. This required us to analyze the data flow to understand where the risks were emerging. It was also helpful to simplify ERPNext through the use of level-0 and level-1 DFD. The core processes and components could be viewed from an architectural stand point, allowing for the data flows to be more clear. We were then able to assess how ERPNext actually behaves, looking a the basic data flow interactions that introduce threats. The assignment also showed the importance of external configurations for hardened security within ERPNext. Overall, it was very useful to create multiple draft diagrams and rely on team collaboration to reach our final diagram/threat report. This assignment also allowed us to further research the existing documentation within ERPNext/Frappe. Overall, this assignment allowed for an architectural approach to threat modeling that was very useful going forward with further analysis of ERPNext as a whole.
